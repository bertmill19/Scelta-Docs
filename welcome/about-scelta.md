## Scelta's Story

Scelta was born in 2023 from my personal experiences as a construction project coordinator and a personal mission to help my Nonna make home selections.

**To my Nonna,**

Who taught me the power of choice & the strength in a good espresso.\
Your challenges with home selections lit a fire in me.\
It wasn’t just about choosing tiles or kitchen counters—it was about control, empowerment, and reshaping how decisions are made in the bricks and mortar of our lives.

Scelta was born from a shared frustration—my Nonna’s as a home buyer and mine as a project coordinator—over the slow, manual, and often pushy home selection process. This common challenge sparked the idea that there had to be a better way, leading to the creation of Scelta, a platform designed to empower users by revolutionizing these outdated practices.

I invested my summer savings from window cleaning into developing the first version of the Scelta Showroom. This innovative platform allowed buyers to visualize their selections in a virtual environment, scaled accurately to their future homes. My Nonna, seeing her selections come to life, told me I had truly given her **'SCELTA'**, which fittingly means **'CHOICE'** in Italian.

Following the initial success, Scelta rolled out the platform to 150 condo buyers. Remarkably, 110 out of 150 early adopters completed their entire home selections online, fully embracing the convenience and innovation of not having to visit a physical showroom.

* 90% decrease in project management time
* 400% increase in upgrades spending

## Beyond Virtual Selections—Empowering the World’s First Generation of Digital General Contractors

Today, Powered by Scelta helps General Contractors automate the tasks they don’t want to do so they can focus on what really matters. By relieving the burden of admin, planning, and client interaction aspects, we empower general contractors and their teams to concentrate on the impactful, hands-on work that defines their craft.

Let’s face it—construction processes could be better.\
So let’s build a better future together.\
