### SCELTA'S STORY.

Scelta was born in 2023 from my personal experiences as a construction project coordinator and a personal mission to help my Nona make home selections.

To my Nonna,

&#x20;

Who taught me the power of choice & the strength in a good espresso.

&#x20;

Your challenges with home selections lit a fire in me.

&#x20;

It wasn’t just about choosing tiles or kitchen counters—it was about control, about empowerment, about reshaping how decisions are made in the bricks and mortar of our lives.\
\
Scelta was born from a shared frustration—my Nonna’s as a home buyer and mine as a project coordinator—over the slow, manual, and often pushy home selection process.&#x20;

&#x20;

This common challenge sparked the idea that there had to be a better way, leading to the creation of Scelta, a platform designed to empower users by revolutionizing these outdated practices.\
\
I invested my summer savings from window cleaning into developing the first version of the Scelta Showroom.\
\
This innovative platform allowed buyers to visualize their selections in a virtual environment, scaled accurately to their future homes. My Nonna, seeing her selections come to life, told me I had truly given her\
\
'SCELTA'.

which fittingly means

in Italian.

'CHOICE',\
\
Following the initial success, Scelta rolled out the platform to 150 condo buyers.\
\
Remarkably, out of these early adopters, 110 out of 150 completed their entire home selections online, fully embracing the convenience and innovation of not having to visit a physical showroom.

​

PLUS:

90% decrease in project management time and

400% increase in upgrades spending\
\
Beyond Virtual Selections—

Empowering the World’s

First Generation of

Digital General Contractors\
\
Today, Powered by Scelta helps General Contractors automate the stuff they don’t want to do so they can do more of the stuff that really matters.\
\
By relieving the burden of admin, planning, and client interaction aspects, we empower general contractors and their teams to concentrate on the impactful, hands-on work that defines their craft.\
\
Let’s face it—construction processes could be better.

So let’s build a better future together.
